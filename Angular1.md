# World Travel Guides Stores

### Setup

Create a repo to host this project and build it as an Angular app. 

### Requirements

For this project you need to use Angular to list a collection of travel guides in the DOM that can be purchased.  A user can add them to a cart and also checkout.

Use the following data as a mock API endpoint:
```
